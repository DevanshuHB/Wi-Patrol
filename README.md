# **✨ Wi-Patrol — WiFi Intrusion Detection System 🚨**

### **🔐 Real-time Protection | 🕵️ Smart Scanning | 📊 Clean UI | 🧠 Built for IoT + Cybersecurity**

---

## **📘 Overview**
**Wi-Patrol** is a lightweight and intelligent **WiFi Intrusion Detection & Monitoring System** built using **Python**, **Tkinter**, and **ESP32**.  
It continuously monitors your network, detects anomalies, logs suspicious devices, and alerts the user instantly — all through a clean and simple interface.

Designed for academic research, cybersecurity learning, and practical network defense.

## **🎯 Key Features**
- **Real-time WiFi scanning** using ESP32  
- **Intrusion detection** (unknown devices, anomalies, probe attempts)  
- **Tkinter GUI** for live monitoring  
- **MySQL database logging** for long-term storage  
- **Config-file based settings** (scan interval, DB access, alert thresholds)  
- **Instant alerts** when suspicious activity is detected  
- **Modular Python codebase** for clean, scalable development  

---

## **🛠️ Tech Stack**
- **Python 3**  
- **Tkinter (GUI)**  
- **MySQL**  
- **ESP32**  
- **JSON / YAML config files**  
- **GitHub version control**

---

## **⚙️ How It Works**
1. **ESP32 scans WiFi signals** and collects device & network data  
2. **Python processes the data**, checks for suspicious devices  
3. **Alerts are triggered** for unknown or abnormal activity  
4. **Data is logged in MySQL** for analysis  
5. **GUI updates in real-time** with network activity
